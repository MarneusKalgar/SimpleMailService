    "content": "No seriously, I have no idea what it means. This term “rapid prototyping” has been bouncing around the UX community for some time and it was making me angry so I looked it up. It’s actually a term from our friends in the manufacturing community. According to Wikipedia, rapid prototyping is defined as group of techniques used to quickly fabricate a scale model of a physical part or assembly using three-dimensional computer aided design (CAD) data…. That means absolutely nothing to me as a digital product designer. Seriously though, if you Google “Rapid Prototyping” you’ll see a bunch of links for manufacturing companies and such. Go ahead, try it. I’ll wait.We in the UX and Product Design community have co-opted this term, stripped it of it’s meaning and use it arbitrarily as some sort of synonym for… working quickly? That’s asinine. In manufacturing, it can take years to do all the necessary research, gather all the materials, design the thing, and build a prototype before its ready to test. So some smart a-hole developed a system where that process doesn’t take as long. and called it rapid prototyping and everyone cheered!",
