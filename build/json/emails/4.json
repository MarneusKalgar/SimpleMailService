    "content": "Angular 2 is written in TypeScript. In this article I will talk about why we made the decision. I’ll also share my experience of working with TypeScript: how it affects the way I write and refactor my code. Even though Angular 2 is written in TypeScript, you don’t have to use it to write Angular 2 applications. The framework also works great with ES5, ES6, and Dart. The biggest selling point of TypeScript is tooling. It provides advanced autocompletion, navigation, and refactoring. Having such tools is almost a requirement for large projects. Without them the fear changing the code puts the code base in a semi-read-only state, and makes large-scale refactorings very risky and costly. TypeScript is not the only typed language that compiles to JavaScript. There are other languages with stronger type systems that in theory can provide absolutely phenomenal tooling. But in practice most of them do not have anything other than a compiler. This is because building rich dev tools has to be an explicit goal from day one, which it has been for the TypeScript team. That is why they built language services that can be used by editors to provide type checking and autocompletion. If you have wondered why there are so many editors with great TypeScript supports, the answer is the language services. The fact that intellisense and basic refactorings (e.g., rename a symbol) are reliable makes a huge impact on the process of writing and especially refactoring code. Although it is hard to measure, I feel that the refactorings that would have taken a few days before now can be done in less than a day. While TypeScript greatly improves the code editing experience, it makes the dev setup more complex, especially comparing to dropping an ES5 script on a page. In addition, you cannot use tools analyzing JavaScript source code (e.g., JSHint), but there are usually adequate replacements.",
